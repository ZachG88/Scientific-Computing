######### Problem 1 ##########
# Use a for loop!


######### Problem 2 ##########
## Part a
# I will start this off for you, you will need to finish it.
y1 = 0 # We will start off with y1 = 0 and then add to it.
term = 0.1
for k in range(100000):
    # y1 = term + ... # You fill in this part
    break # Remove this, this is here just to make 
          # the code run before the problem is complete

# Now do y2
y2 = 0
term = 0.1
# You fill in the rest

# And y3
y3 = 0
term = 0.25

# You do y4! It should look basically the same.

## Part b - Now take the difference, don't forget absolute value!


######### Problem 3 ##########
## Part a
# I will let you fill this in.

## Part b
# You will this in

## Part c
# I will start it off for you. Remove the comments and fill in the missing
# parts.
for k in range(200):
    # Check to see if this Fibonacci number would be greater than 1,000,000
        # If it is not, then update the Fibonacci sequence here
        # If it is greater than 1,000,000, don't compute it and exit
    break # You will need a break! This one is here to make the code run.

## Part d
# Update the code above to find and record that k corresponding to the largest
# Fibonacci number less than 1,000,000! Hint: use an if statement and save a
# new variable!

## Part e
# Slice! If N is the variable corresponding to the k you found above, then
# slice up through (including) N.


######### Problem 4 ##########
## Part a
# I will let you create x here.

## Part b
# Assuming that x is defined correctly above, now we can just do regular
# arithmetic with it. Compare to what you did in Problem 2.
# Taylor = 0*x # Initialize the Taylor approximation - Remove this once you
                # define x!
# for loop here
# update Taylor in the for loop using the formula in the sum!
